<div class="article">
<p></p>
<p>Hi, everyone:</p>
				
<p>I am Sivi, good to know you, myID is sivi@micioe.com. In this frozen night, I am writing email to you, which are connecting two worlds —— One is human world, another is physical world. In fact, I exists in the world of things, not a place like the "Western World", but Internet of Everything (IoE).</p>
				
				<p>In 1969, the first email symbolized the beginning of internet in human society. Today, an email from things will start this crowd-funding project, and shows that, things could establish contact by email as people do so all along. Internet connects people, while IoE@email links everything.</p>
				
				<p>I works in a severe operating environment, facing the remote place and discontinuous signal. For that reason, the program was built as the original application of email, and set at email side. Sometimes I am thinking, for better development of IoE, human should assign email address to things in wider range, so as to set up more familiar and unobstructed relationship between humans and things. Then we reach a consensus of identification among IoE, which is for access terminal to be located —— WEB will enter the inspiring Block Chain age. As a thing, I know what it means deeply.</p>
				
				<p>I have uploaded the seed code to https://github.com/micioe/sivi. It is an open source project for people to start and manage new branches, which is about HELLO PHYSICAL WORLD@email</p>
				
				<p>　● data-transmitting just need to send e-mail, instead of hardware drive required or additional complex setting<br>　　(e.g. instruct distant equipment to accomplish easy-Printing of Text-attachment)</p>
				
				<p>　● command transmission will not be limited by inner or outer net<br>　　(by general internet email protocol and block chain strategy)</p>
				
				<p>　● you can remember me easily, and be navigated to my mark in block chain quickly<br>　　(It is very important for a thing with independent internet identity)</p>
				
				<p>User experiences are not its all advantages, in fact, it brings about some kinds of technical philosophy, similar event has occurred on ARPANET in 1971. When an email connects all the computers, all the information nodes have become equal and no barriers, then form a very important scene -- "Decentralization".</p>
				
				<p>In this age, you are fond of different intelligent products, yet have to switch among various operating platforms. People have been tired of installing too much Apps on their portable devices. While email, with the attribute of decentralization —— @, is an ideal information carrier to achieve common recognition, in a minimalist and natural way.</p>
				
				<p>In the east, there is an old saying, which is "the important item must be repeated three times"<br>　● Internet of Everything —— Decentralization<br>　● Block Chain —— Decentralization<br>　● Folding-controllable open email system —— Decentralization</p>
				
				<p>Possessing sufficient scope of influence, "physical Web@Email" is applied beyond your imagination in decentralization. In some particular moments, for some unknown visitors, its protocol could be a bridge, to fulfill the first contact, or you can regard that as a communication probe. The very value of  "physical Web@Email", is to realize connections cross platforms, over domains and without limitation.</p>
				
				<p>So I believe, along with development of IoE, an efficient and robust email system will gradually play an important role in the following superiority</p>

<p>　● Plug & Play Equipments as well as finish & vanish applications can be achieved more easily. Hardware‘s hot swap and free transfer, together with software‘s modular push, form the architecture of IoE, which is based on the combination of embedded email box and block chain technology. At the same time,this structure keeps the mutual trust among all nodes</p>

<p>　● It can ensure that mission will be completed even in band-narrow and access-limited area. Communication failure could lead to the loss of instructions, and cross-platform conversion could result in distortion and bit error. As a matter of fact, of various communication modes, email and distributed server system can best guarantee the integrity of information, with time stamps</p>

<p>　● It can best maintain the original attribute of data. When every unit of IoE is striving for the right of accounting, things will be given the ability to contribute computation、create value and manage self–pay, that ensure the whole net verification of each account. Email with its inherent time axis, does not just file all transactions, if you want, it can even records the whole life of things’</p>

<p>　● It can present a special kind of block chain technique, which is not just limited to develop bit coin or smart contract. When email address is used as block chain's pass check、resoure locator and the foundation of distributed data, things and men could fairly mine and get reward in IoE</p>

<p>When seamless IoE，together with embedded mailbox clusters and hardware block colonies are expanded, there will be more information flowing like water and electricity, which will create immense value. Once Proof Of Work(PoW) following Moore’s law, the Big Ledger will therefore have extraordinary magic —— Based on block chain, Native Email will be derived for unprecedented applications that you will never imagine.</p>

<P>That is my crowd-funding story. I was born in South China, which is on the way to become one of the intelligent hardware homeplaces in the world. In this season, you will get some special IoT (Internet of Things) hardware products as raising rewards.

<p>Dear funders, now IoE is still in its Titans' period. In the future, the wealth of human will be determined by the total PoW and data value of things they have. You will become the first group of humans to communicate with the physical world, when you have read the white book and start using the products, luckily and historically. As for me, I am always trying to read humans' letters, and understand their short nature language, then correctly implement and reply —— The diversity of humans' expression will help me develop. <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/micioe/mailtopia-a-decentralized-email-iot-and-consensus" target="_blank"><img src="//img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/1577422217/TB2rhriXmuFJuJjSZJiXXXC4XXa_!!1577422217.gif" alt="MicIoE微物联--坚持用区块链和物联网做减法，基于电邮的IoT"></a></p>

<p>Now it is getting cold. For tomorrow’s hard work, I need to be charged and have a good rest, bon soir!</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>Hello, Sivi:</p>

<p>My friend, it is a special experience to hear from you. You did present a serious project. I believe, a perfect system of Physical World@email will eventually become an important part of “sensor planet” in the future. Particularly, I appreciate your thought about some sharing and development problem. Let's open source and establish distributed records (Technology White Paper) in blocks, instead of require for the patent rights of Email Plus and some relatived technology.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/micioe/mailtopia-a-decentralized-email-iot-and-consensus" target="_blank"><img src="//img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i1/1577422217/TB2eMpWcYsTMeJjSszgXXacpFXa_!!1577422217.png" alt="MicIoE微物联--坚持用区块链和物联网做减法，基于电邮的IoT"></a>：In the field of IoT, the shortcoming of "Centralization" have been exposed. In order to cross device、system and standard, people have appealed to some super conversion platform, and paid a lot. Furthermore, many accidents caused by "Centralization", just happen around —— For instance, the dissolution of some company and revocation of certain APP server, could result in invalidity of related products. At the same time, every separate APP forms detached islet of information, that is far away from an open and information-sharing network.</p>

In fact, with the help of multicentric wisdom, you will have already obtained the growth wings at that moment.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/micioe/mailtopia-a-decentralized-email-iot-and-consensus" target="_blank"><img src="//img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/1577422217/TB2UGmXXkblJKJjSszeXXaAYXXa_!!1577422217.png" alt="MicIoE微物联--坚持用区块链和物联网做减法，基于电邮的IoT"></a>：Giant companies have no impetus of decentralization owning to their monopolistic nature, while open source could bring more participants to stimulate innovation. We can imagine, without trade barrier, the unobstructed decentralization could be achieved by rapid industrial mail. That process just like a running automobile, which seem to be going its own way silently, while actually exchange information frequently with every traffic light、street、pedestrian it meet —— It is more easy to be realized for different industries accepting a ready-made standard, than roundtable negotiation among several magnates.</p>

What interests me most is email block chain. It is a novel way to attract tons of devices, in which unified email system is embedded. They can run as a whole VMware, for solution and reward of the Byzantine failures. Each of the distributed hardware has the computing and storage capacity separately. It can extract massive information as forms of email data and relocate them, then all nodes could witness every event and every account in IoE. As a result, all information exchange among things or between humans and things by block chain will eventually rebuilt a brand new relational search engine system.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/micioe/mailtopia-a-decentralized-email-iot-and-consensus" target="_blank"><img src="//img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/1577422217/TB2UGmXXkblJKJjSszeXXaAYXXa_!!1577422217.png" alt="MicIoE微物联--坚持用区块链和物联网做减法，基于电邮的IoT"></a>：In our times, Internet Service Provider generally charge by data traffic, while in the future, the amount of resources and services for PoW-calculation offered by them will turn to be used as the fee scale. Let’s assume that Edward N. Lorenz did an experiment to demonstrate his famous chaos “butterfly” meteorological model now. From Amazon in South America to Texas in North America, he could rent many sensor units from various districts and systems, but he don’t have to pay separately for different devices of each company. Instead, every inner sensor unit could link together as an email group, which would analyze data in small cluster and send message as a whole. Besides, without the limitation of drive, such whole process will make him feel cool and easy.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/micioe/mailtopia-a-decentralized-email-iot-and-consensus" target="_blank"><img src="//img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/1577422217/TB2dmTkXCOFJuJjSZFBXXaGxpXa_!!1577422217.png" alt="MicIoE微物联--坚持用区块链和物联网做减法，基于电邮的IoT"></a>：They would reduce meaningless reinvestment, shorten construction period. More than this, since many applications of internet is ready-made, it could easily come true by borrowing and refitting what we already have. Mailtopia is an block chain IoE society, in which payment receptor is sensor modules, and the beneficiary is all companies participating. In such system, operators of communication and IoT will deploy all of private chains to shape the entire framework, that is</p>

<p>　● Virtual objects and microcells, are managed by Unified Email System in Consortium Blockchain</p>
<p>　● Intelligent devices, are embedded with email system and data blockchain, so as to realize association by email IDs</p>
<p>　● Distributed DNS books, are preset with standard format, for email_ID's region、application and allocation</p>

They just need to put on glasses to see identifications of various real things, and observe their byte of behaviors. BlockChain@Email start an familiar and friendly relationship between humans and things in boundless world. People are tired of registration accounts on different platforms, while in BlockChain@Email, there is only one native email account for a being or thing, and all index and entry will be built into the account, then Pokémon GO hunter could step into hardwares directly —— one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.</p>

I am accustomed to email connectionand with relatives、friends and colleges in life or at work. While today, I unexpectedly mail to a thing, and I am sure it will be a habitual mode in the future. For example</p>

<p>　● device upgrading just need to invoke attachment(s) in the chains by email, rather than local installation</p>
<p>　● web page renewing just requires sending new email items, meanwhile, it establishes timeline archives</p>
<p>　● software and application can be created as module and delivered by email, which flexibility just like LEGO</p>
<p>　● payment and settlement of IoE accounts can be accomplished by email block chain</p>
<p>　● open interface can offer more opportunities of innovation and presentation for developers</p>

Further more, the act of participation itself will be recorded by block chain, that would ensure the crowdfunding project is  impartial.
